# CRLF Normalizer
An LF to CRLF converter to convert any files in any directory to CRLF.

If you normalize the same repo directory often, you can easily make a shortcut to normalize a specific directory with one click by sending the root, file endings, whether you want blank lines and indents or not (1 or 0), and whether you want tabs to be broken into spaces or not (1 or 0) as parameters in a short one-line script:  
    @normalize.cmd "c:\blah\blah\myrepo" ".txt .py" 0 1

You can download this repo from the below link to get started:
