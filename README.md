# CRLF Normalizer
Normalize any files in any directory to CRLF.

If you normalize the same repo directory often, you can easily make a shortcut to normalize a specific directory with one click by sending the root, file endings, whether you want blank lines and indents or not (1/0), and whether you want tabs to be broken into spaces or not (1/0) as parameters in a short one-line script:  
    @normalize.cmd "c:\blah\blah\myrepo" ".txt .py" 1 1
